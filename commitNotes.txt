Commit ID: #6 - Of Current Branch
Current Branch: 001_Developer[v0.0.2]
Date: 03/16/2025
Time Spent: 8.25 hours
Changed version:
	Developer [v0.0.53]
	Game [v0.0.41]

	Commit notes (expanded):
		• Began developing the mouse functionality
		•  Learned how to use pynput to handle mouse and keyboard events
			• Determined that mouse events are better handled by tkinter's event logic
			• Can determine when the mouse is inside the root canvas and can generate the edit menu widget to screen
			• Using pynput for mouse events got laggy when I tried to post a menu widget
		• The pynput.keyboard will be very powerful. Huge potential for the game
		• Should determine if input Node should be a child class to widgets, benefits include: access to render & mainApp, access to any pre-made widgets, access to file logic.
			• If I do this, making shortcuts should be very possible and even easy. 
		- Need to make documentation for inputNode. 

	Future Plans:
		- Create Exception logic for existing code. Next Branch - 002_ExceptionLogic[v0]

	Current Bugs:
		1. game.py is broken due to changes in windowNode.py for project developer [v0.0.1]
		2. Pressing q will close all tkinter windows. Potential solution: A way to identify different instances and assign some form of ID. 
		3. When creating a button through the mouse right-click, it activates the Leave event. (Not Major)
		4. when calling widget.post(x, y) the coords are offset unless I add _root after x, y

	Bugs Squashed:
