Addition Notes for Commits

    Changed version: [v0.0.41]

    GUI_Main was a redundant class, I could just create a different instance of mainTkinter.py class for the map maker

    Finished documentation for Engine and Entity modules.
        game.py and mapMaker.py need documentation still.
        Will change Engine\mapMaker.py do a different name.
