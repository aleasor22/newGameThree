Addition Notes for Commits

    Changed version:    Game [v0.0.41]
                        Developer [v0.0.1]

    Can now easily change size of the tkinter window & Canvas. Can now show the grid on the developer.py tkinter window. With the ability to turn on & off effectively. 
        

    Discovered how reStructured Text (RST) works, planning to re-write documentation to utilize RST. So that I can hover over
    Methods & Classes and get a good description of what they do in VS Code. 

    Got heavily sidetracked with a couple of things, however I cleaned up my OneNotes and how they were organized. I also explanded on ideas that I initially wrote down. 

    Future Plans:
        Should or Does the ID of the visual boxes need to match the __gridSpot list?
        Tiles Maps: Goal to expand on this idea, will incorporate todays (3/8/25) work, and may improve how collision is handled. 
        Revisit Sphinx autodoc??? ***PROBABLY NOT - MASSIVE AMMOUNTS OF TIME WAS WASTED ON THIS BEFORE***
